<!--Step 1
JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

Note: For all remaining projects in this curriculum, you will need a basic level of knowledge in HTML and CSS. If you are new to HTML and CSS, please go through the Responsive Web Design Certification.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
   <!--Step 2
Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element. This element is used to load JavaScript into your HTML file.

Example Code
<script>
  // JavaScript code goes here
</script>-->
   <!--Step 3
One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending on your browser, this might be opened by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. On Mac, you can press Option + âŒ˜ + C and select "Console". You can also click the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.

The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code, but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is helpful for debugging.

Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text "Hello World".-->
   <!--Step 4
Before you start writing your project code, you should move it to its own file to keep things organized.

Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line. Then give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js.-->
   <script src="./script.js">
      console.log("Hello World");
   </script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!--Step 11
In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.

Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.-->
<!--Step 12
Create three span elements within your #stats element. Give each of them the class stat. Then give the first one the text XP: 0, the second one the text Health: 100, and the third one the text Gold: 50.-->

<body>
   <div id="game">
      <div id="stats">
         <span class="stat">XP: 0</span>
         <span class="stat">Health: 100</span>
         <span class="stat">Gold: 50</span>
      </div>
      <div id="controls">

      </div>
      <div id="monsterStats">

      </div>
      <div id="text">

      </div>
   </div>
</body>

</html>
