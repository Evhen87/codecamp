<!--Step 1
JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

Note: For all remaining projects in this curriculum, you will need a basic level of knowledge in HTML and CSS. If you are new to HTML and CSS, please go through the Responsive Web Design Certification.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 16
   We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a button element, but your script tag is in the head of your HTML. This means your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML, and your document.querySelector() will not see the button - because the browser hasn't processed it yet.
   
   To fix this, move your script element out of the head element, and place it at the end of your body element (just before the closing </body> tag).-->

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
   <!--Step 2
Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element. This element is used to load JavaScript into your HTML file.

Example Code
<script>
  // JavaScript code goes here
</script>-->
   <!--Step 3
One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending on your browser, this might be opened by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. On Mac, you can press Option + âŒ˜ + C and select "Console". You can also click the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.

The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code, but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is helpful for debugging.

Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text "Hello World".-->
   <!--Step 4
Before you start writing your project code, you should move it to its own file to keep things organized.

Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line. Then give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js.-->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!--Step 11
In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.

Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.-->
<!--Step 12
Create three span elements within your #stats element. Give each of them the class stat. Then give the first one the text XP: 0, the second one the text Health: 100, and the third one the text Gold: 50.-->
<!--Step 13
Wrap the numbers 0, 100, and 50 in span elements, and wrap those new span elements in strong elements. Then give your new span elements id values of xpText, healthText, and goldText, respectively.

Your answer should follow this basic structure:

Example Code
<span class="stat">TEXT <strong><span id="VALUE">TEXT</span></strong></span>-->

<body>
   <div id="game">
      <div id="stats">
         <span class="stat">XP: <strong><span id="xpText">0</span></strong></span>
         <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="healthText"></span>100</span></strong></span>
         <span class="stat">Gold: <strong><span id="goldText"></span>50</span></strong></span>
      </div>
      <!--Step 14
For your #controls element, create three button elements. The first should have the id set to button1, and the text Go to store. The second should have the id set to button2, and the text Go to cave. The third should have the id set to button3, and the text Fight dragon.-->
      <div id="controls">
         <button id="button1">Go to store</button>
         <button id="button2">Go to cave</button>
         <button id="button3">Fight dragon</button>
      </div>
      <div id="monsterStats">

      </div>
      <div id="text">

      </div>
   </div>
   <script src="./script.js">
   </script>
</body>

</html>
