/*Step 5
//Your view has been switched to your new script.js file. Remember that you can use the tabs above to switch between files.

//Add your console.log("Hello World"); line to this file, and see it appear in your console.*/
/*Step 6
//Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line to begin writing your project code.

//In the previous project, you learned how to work with variables and the let keyword like this:

//Example Code
//let camperbot;
//You also learned how to initialize a variable with a value like this:

//Example Code
//let age = 32;
//Use the let keyword to declare a variable called xp and assign it the value of 0, a number.*/
/*Step 7
Initialize another variable called health with a value of 100, and a variable called gold with a value of 50.*/
/*Step 8
Create another variable called currentWeaponIndex and set it to 0.*/
/*Step 9
Declare a variable called fighting but do not initialize it with a value.*/
/*Step 10
//Declare two more variables named monsterHealth and inventory.

//For your inventory variable, assign it the value of an array containing the string "stick".

//Remember that you worked with arrays in the previous project like this:

//Example Code
//let exampleArray = ["first", "second", "third"];*/
