/*Step 14
It is time to start writing the script that makes your form work.

To access an HTML element with a given id name, you can use the getElementById() method. Here's an example of how to use this method:

Example Code
<h1 id="title">Main title</h1>
Example Code
const mainTitleElement = document.getElementById('title');
Begin by getting the form element (using the id) and storing it in a variable called calorieCounter.*/
/*Step 15
Get your #budget element and assign it to budgetNumberInput, and your #entry-dropdown element and assign it to entryDropdown.*/
/*Step 16
Following the same pattern, assign your #add-entry element to addEntryButton, your #clear element to clearButton, and your #output element to output.*/
/*Step 17
In programming, prefixing a variable with is or has is a common practice to signify that the variable represents a boolean value.

Here are a few examples:

Example Code
let isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;
Declare a variable named isError using let and initialize it with false, allowing for its reassignment later.

Later on in the project, you will update the value of isError if the user provides an invalid input.*/
const calorieCounter = document.getElementById('calorie-counter');
const budgetNumberInput = document.getElementById('budget');
const entryDropdown = document.getElementById('entry-dropdown');
const addEntryButton = document.getElementById('add-entry');
const clearButton = document.getElementById('clear');
const output = document.getElementById('output');
let isError = false;
/*Step 18
When the user inputs their daily calorie budget, the input field will only accept numerical values. However, if a number is entered with a + or - sign, you'll need to remove those characters.

Start by declaring a cleanInputString function that takes a str parameter.

NOTE: Values from an HTML input field are received as strings in JavaScript. You'll need to convert these strings into numbers before performing any calculations. Converting string values into numbers will be covered in a future step.*/
/*Step 19
To match specific characters in a string, you can use Regular Expressions or "regex" for short.

Regex in JavaScript is indicated by a pattern wrapped in forward slashes. The following example will match the string literal "hello":

Example Code
const regex = /hello/;
Declare a regex variable and assign it the value from the example above. In future steps, you will update this regex pattern to match specific characters needed for the calorie counter.*/
/*Step 20
The current pattern will match the exact text "hello", which is not the desired behavior. Instead, you want to search for +, -, or spaces. Replace the pattern in your regex variable with \+- to match plus and minus characters.

Note that you need to use the backslash \ character to escape the + symbol because it has a special meaning in regular expressions.*/
/*Step 21
In regex, shorthand character classes allow you to match specific characters without having to write those characters in your pattern. Shorthand character classes are preceded with a backslash (\). The character class \s will match any whitespace character. Add this to your regex pattern.*/
/*Step 22
Your current pattern won't work just yet. /+-\s/ looks for +, -, and a space in order. This would match +- hello but would not match +hello.

To tell the pattern to match each of these characters individually, you need to turn them into a character class. This is done by wrapping the characters you want to match in brackets. For example, this pattern will match the characters h, e, l, or o:

Example Code
const regex = /[helo]/;
Turn your +-\s pattern into a character class. Note that you no longer need to escape the + character, because you are using a character class.*/
/*Step 24
JavaScript provides a .replace() method that enables you to replace characters in a string with another string. This method accepts two arguments. The first argument is the character sequence to be replaced, which can be either a string or a regex pattern. The second argument is the string that replaces the matched sequence.

Since strings are immutable, the replace method returns a new string with the replaced characters.

In this example, the replace method is used to replace all instances of the letter l with the number 1 in the string hello.

Example Code
"hello".replace(/l/g, "1");
Use your regex to replace all instances of +, -, and a space in str with an empty string. Return this value.*/
/*Step 27
Once you have finished testing your cleanInputString function, you can remove both of your console statements.*/
function cleanInputString(str) {
   /*Step 25
Now it is time to test out your cleanInputString function.

Inside your cleanInputString function, add a console.log() statement with two arguments. The first argument should be the string "original string: " and the second argument should be the str parameter.*/
   const regex = /[+-\s]/g;
   return str.replace(regex, '');
}
/*Step 26
To see the results from the cleanInputString function, you will need to add a console.log() statement. Inside that console statement, call the cleanInputString function with the string value of "+-99" as an argument.

Open up the console and you should see the original string followed by the cleaned string value with the +- removed.*/
/*Step 28
In HTML, number inputs allow for exponential notation (such as 1e10). You need to filter those out.

Start by creating a function called isInvalidInput – it should take a single str parameter.*/
/*Step 29
Declare a regex variable, and assign it a regex that matches the character e.*/
/*Step 30
The e in a number input can also be an uppercase E. Regex has a flag for this, however – the i flag, which stands for "insensitive".

Example Code
/Hello/i
The regex above would match hello, Hello, HELLO, and even hElLo because of the i flag. This flag makes your pattern case-insensitive.

Add the i flag to your regex pattern.*/
/*Step 31
Number inputs only allow the e to occur between two digits. To match any number, you can use the character class [0-9]. This will match any digit between 0 and 9.

Add this character class before and after e in your pattern.*/
/*Step 32
The + modifier in a regex allows you to match a pattern that occurs one or more times. To match your digit pattern one or more times, add a plus after each of the digit character classes. For example: [0-9]+.*/
function isInvalidInput(str) {
   const regex = /[0-9]+e[0-9]+/i;
}
