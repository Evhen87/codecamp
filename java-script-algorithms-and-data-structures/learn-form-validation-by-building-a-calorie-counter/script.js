/*Step 14
It is time to start writing the script that makes your form work.

To access an HTML element with a given id name, you can use the getElementById() method. Here's an example of how to use this method:

Example Code
<h1 id="title">Main title</h1>
Example Code
const mainTitleElement = document.getElementById('title');
Begin by getting the form element (using the id) and storing it in a variable called calorieCounter.*/
/*Step 15
Get your #budget element and assign it to budgetNumberInput, and your #entry-dropdown element and assign it to entryDropdown.*/
/*Step 16
Following the same pattern, assign your #add-entry element to addEntryButton, your #clear element to clearButton, and your #output element to output.*/
/*Step 17
In programming, prefixing a variable with is or has is a common practice to signify that the variable represents a boolean value.

Here are a few examples:

Example Code
let isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;
Declare a variable named isError using let and initialize it with false, allowing for its reassignment later.

Later on in the project, you will update the value of isError if the user provides an invalid input.*/
const calorieCounter = document.getElementById('calorie-counter');
const budgetNumberInput = document.getElementById('budget');
const entryDropdown = document.getElementById('entry-dropdown');
const addEntryButton = document.getElementById('add-entry');
const clearButton = document.getElementById('clear');
const output = document.getElementById('output');
let isError = false;
