      <h1>Calorie Counter</h1>
      <div class="container">
         <!--Step 1
In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

You have been provided with boilerplate CSS and HTML. However, you need to build your calorie counter form.

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS, then add a form element and give it an id set to calorie-counter.-->
         <!--Step 2
In your form, users will be able to input a number which represents their daily calorie budget.

Create a label element, give it a for attribute set to budget and the text Budget, then create an input element with the id set to budget.-->
         <!--Step 3
Your input element needs some additional attributes. Give it a type set to number to only allow numeric inputs, a min attribute set to 0 to only allow positive numbers, and a placeholder set to Daily calorie budget.

Finally, mark the input element as required.         -->
         <form action="" id="calorie-counter">
            <label for="budget">Budget</label>
            <input type="number" id="budget" min="0" placeholder="Daily calorie budget" required>
            <!--Step 4
In your form, users should have the capability to add various meal types along with their calorie counts.

Create a fieldset element with the id set to breakfast.

Within that element, create a legend with the text Breakfast, and an empty div with the class set to input-container.-->
            <fieldset id="breakfast">
               <legend>Breakfast</legend>
               <div class="input-container"></div>
            </fieldset>
            <!--Step 5
Next, create a fieldset element with the id set to lunch.

Within that element, create a legend element with the text Lunch, and an empty div with the class set to input-container.-->
            <fieldset id="lunch">
               <legend>Lunch</legend>
               <div class="input-container"></div>
            </fieldset>
            <!--Step 6
Continuing the pattern, create a fieldset for dinner with the same nested elements.-->
            <fieldset id="dinner">
               <legend>Dinner</legend>
               <div class="input-container"></div>
            </fieldset>
            <!--Step 7
You need two more of these fieldset code blocks â€“ one for snacks and one for exercise.-->
            <fieldset id="snacks">
               <legend>Snacks</legend>
               <div class="input-container"></div>
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset id="exercise">
               <legend>Exercise</legend>
               <div class="input-container"></div>
            </fieldset>
            <!--Step 8
When users want to select a meal type to input their calorie counts, they should be presented with a dropdown menu and a button to add the meal type.

Start by creating a div element and assign it a class attribute with the value controls. Then, nest a span element inside this div.-->
            <div class="controls">
               <span></span>
            </div>
         </form>
      </div>
   </main>
</body>
