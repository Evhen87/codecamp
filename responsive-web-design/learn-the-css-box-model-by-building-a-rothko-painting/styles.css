/*Step 8
Time for CSS.

Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content. Write a CSS rule that uses the .canvas class selector and set its width to 500 pixels. Here's a CSS rule that sets the width of the class card to 300 pixels:

Example Code
.card {
  width: 300px;
}*/
 /*Step 9
Add the height property with the value 600px to your .canvas rule.*/
/*Step 10
Change the background-color of the canvas to #4d0f00.*/
.canvas {
   width: 500px;
   height: 600px;
   background-color: #4d0f00;
 }
 /*Step 12
Write a new rule using the .frame class selector.

Use the border shorthand declaration to give the .frame element a solid, black border with a width of 50px.*/
/*Step 13
The frame is much too wide.

In .frame, set its width to 500 pixels.*/
/*Step 14
Use padding to adjust the spacing within an element.

In .frame, use the padding shorthand property to increase the space between the .frame and .canvas elements by 50px. The shorthand will increase space in the top, bottom, left, and right of the element's border and canvas within.*/
/*Step 15
Use margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.

Using the margin property, give the .frame element vertical margin of 20px, and horizontal margin of auto. This will move the frame down 20 pixels and horizontally center it on the page.*/
.frame {
   border: solid 50px black;
   width: 500px;
   padding: 50px;
   margin: 20px auto;
}
/*Step 17
Write a new rule that targets .one and set its width to 425 pixels.*/
.one {
   width: 425px;
}
