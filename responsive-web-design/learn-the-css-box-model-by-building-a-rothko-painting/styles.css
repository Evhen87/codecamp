/*Step 8
Time for CSS.

Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content. Write a CSS rule that uses the .canvas class selector and set its width to 500 pixels. Here's a CSS rule that sets the width of the class card to 300 pixels:

Example Code
.card {
  width: 300px;
}*/
 /*Step 9
Add the height property with the value 600px to your .canvas rule.*/
/*Step 10
Change the background-color of the canvas to #4d0f00.*/
/*Step 21
Now .one is centered horizontally, but its top margin is pushing past the canvas and onto the frame's border, shifting the entire canvas down 20 pixels.

Add padding of 1px to the .canvas element to give the .one element something solid to push off of.*/
/*Step 22
Adding 1 pixel of padding to the top, bottom, left, and right of the canvas changed its dimensions to 502 pixels x 602 pixels.

Replace the padding property with overflow set to hidden - changing the canvas back to its original dimensions.*/
/*Step 34
The colors and shapes of your painting are too sharp to pass as a Rothko.

Use the filter property to blur the painting by 2px in the .canvas element.

Here's an example of a rule that add a 3px blur:

Example Code
p {
  filter: blur(3px);
}*/
.canvas {
   width: 500px;
   height: 600px;
   background-color: #4d0f00;
   overflow: hidden;
   filter: blur(2px);
 }
 /*Step 12
Write a new rule using the .frame class selector.

Use the border shorthand declaration to give the .frame element a solid, black border with a width of 50px.*/
/*Step 13
The frame is much too wide.

In .frame, set its width to 500 pixels.*/
/*Step 14
Use padding to adjust the spacing within an element.

In .frame, use the padding shorthand property to increase the space between the .frame and .canvas elements by 50px. The shorthand will increase space in the top, bottom, left, and right of the element's border and canvas within.*/
/*Step 15
Use margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.

Using the margin property, give the .frame element vertical margin of 20px, and horizontal margin of auto. This will move the frame down 20 pixels and horizontally center it on the page.*/
.frame {
   border: solid 50px black;
   width: 500px;
   padding: 50px;
   margin: 20px auto;
}
/*Step 17
Write a new rule that targets .one and set its width to 425 pixels.*/
/*Step 18
Now set the height for .one to 150 pixels.*/
/*Step 19
Set the background-color of .one to #efb762.*/
/*Step 20
Use margins to position the .one element on the canvas.

Add the shorthand margin property with a vertical margin of 20px and a horizontal margin of auto.*/
/*Step 37
The rectangles are too small and their edges don't have the soft quality of a painting.

Increase the area and soften the edges of .one by setting its box-shadow to 0 0 3px 3px #efb762.*/
.one {
   width: 425px;
   height: 150px;
   background-color: #efb762;
   margin: 20px auto;
   box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px #efb762;
}
/*Step 24
Create a new CSS rule using the .two selector and set its width to 475 pixels.*/
/*Step 25
Set the height of the .two element to 200 pixels.*/
/*Step 26
Set the background-color of the .two element to #8f0401.*/
/*Step 27
Center the .two element by setting its margin to auto.*/
/*Step 33
It's helpful to have your margins push in one direction.

In this case, the bottom margin of the .one element pushes .two down 20 pixels.

In the .two selector, use margin shorthand property to set top margin to 0, horizontal margin to auto, and bottom margin to 20px. This will remove its top margin, horizontally center it, and set its bottom margin to 20 pixels.*/
/*Step 38
Use the same box-shadow declaration for .two, but change the color from #efb762 to #8f0401.*/
.two {
   width: 475px;
   height: 200px;
   background-color: #8f0401;
   margin: 0 auto 20px;
   box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px #8f0401;
 }
 /*Step 35
Create a rule that targets both .one and .two and increase their blur effect by 1 pixel.*/
.one, .two {
   filter: blur(1px);
}
 /*Step 29
You don't always have to use pixels when sizing an element.

Create a new rule, .three, and set its width to 91%.*/
/*Step 30
Set the height of .three to 28%.*/
/*Step 31
Change the background-color of .three to #b20403.*/
/*Step 32
Center the .three element on the canvas by setting its margin to auto.*/
/*Step 36
Increase the blur of .three by 2 pixels.*/
/*Step 39
Add a box-shadow to .three with the values 0 0 5px 5px #b20403.*/
.three {
   width: 91%;
   height: 28%;
   background-color: #b20403;
   margin: auto;
   filter: blur(2px);
   box-shadow: 0 0 5px 5px #b20403;
}
