<!--Step 1
By now, you should be familiar with the basic elements an HTML page should have.

Set up your code with a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element with the language set to English, a head element, and a body element.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 2
   Within the head element, add a meta tag which sets the charset to UTF-8, and a title element with the value Rothko Painting.
   
   Within the body element, add an img element with a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png.-->

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Rothko Painting</title>
</head>

<body>
   <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png" alt="">
</body>
