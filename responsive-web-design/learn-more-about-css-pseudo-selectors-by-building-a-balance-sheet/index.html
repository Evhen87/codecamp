<!--Step 1
Set up your HTML with the DOCTYPE, html indicating this document is in English, head, and body elements.

Give your head element the appropriate meta elements for the charset and viewport, a title element with an appropriate title, and a link element for your stylesheet.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Responsive Web Design</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!--Step 2
Within your body element, nest a section element within a main element.-->

<body>
   <main>
      <!--Step 3
Within your section element, add an h1 element with a nested span element.-->
      <section>
         <h1>
            <!--Step 4
Screen readers announce HTML elements based on the document flow. We will eventually want the balance sheet to have a heading of "Balance Sheet" and a subheading of "AcmeWidgetCorp". However, this order does not make sense if announced by a screen reader.

Give your existing span the class attribute set to flex, and add two span elements within it. Give the first the text AcmeWidgetCorp. Give the second the text Balance Sheet. You will use CSS to reverse the order of the text on the page, but the HTML order will make more sense for a screen reader.-->
            <span class="flex">
               <span>AcmeWidgetCorp</span>
               <span>Balance Sheet</span>

            </span>
         </h1>
      </section>
   </main>
</body>
