<!--Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.-->
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 2
   You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
   
   Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
   
   The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.-->

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Document</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>
