<!--Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.-->
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 2
   You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
   
   Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
   
   The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.-->
<!--Step 3
   Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
   
   Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.-->
<!--Step 4
   Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
   
   Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.-->
<!--Step 5
   Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.
   
   Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise.-->

<head>
   <meta name="description" content="freeCodeCamp Accessibility Quiz practice project">
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Accessibility Quiz</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!--Step 6
Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.

Add a header and a main element to your page.

The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.

The main element will contain the core content of your page.-->

<body>
   <!--Step 7
Within the header, provide context about the page by nesting one img, h1, and nav element.

The img should point to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg, have an id of logo, and have an alt text of freeCodeCamp.

The h1 should contain the text HTML/CSS Quiz.-->
   <header>
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg" alt="freeCodeCamp" id="logo">
      <h1>HTML/CSS Quiz</h1>
      <!--Step 12
To enable navigation on the page, add an unordered list with the following three list items:

INFO
HTML
CSS
The list items text should be wrapped in anchor tags.-->
      <nav>
         <!--Step 18
To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element an href corresponding to the id of the h2 elements.-->
         <ul>
            <li><a href="#student-info">INFO</a></li>
            <li><a href="#html-questions">HTML</a></li>
            <li><a href="#css-questions">CSS</a></li>
         </ul>
      </nav>
   </header>
   <!--Step 14
As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers. You can semantically separate the content within the form using section elements.

Within the main element, create a form with three nested section elements. Then, make the form submit to https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz, using the correct method.-->
   <main>
      <!--Step 15
To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

Give each of the section elements the region role.-->
      <!--Step 16
Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.

Add the following aria-labelledby attributes to the section elements:

student-info
html-questions
css-questions
Then, within each section element, nest one h2 element with an id matching the corresponding aria-labelledby attribute. Give each h2 suitable text content.-->
      <!--Step 41
Do not forget to give your form a submit button with the text Send.-->
      <form method="post" action="https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz">
         <!--Step 19
Filling out the content of the quiz, below #student-info, add three div elements with a class of info.

Then, within each div nest one label element, and one input element.-->
         <!--Step 20
It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.

This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input.

This section will take a student's name, email address, and date of birth. Give the label elements appropriate for attributes, as well as text content. Then, link the input elements to the corresponding label elements.-->
         <section role="region" aria-labelledby="student-info">
            <h2 id="student-info">Student Info</h2>
            <!--Step 22
Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.

Remove the placeholder text from the first input element, relying on the label being the best-practice.-->
            <div class="info">
               <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
               <input id="student-name" type="text" name="student-name" />
            </div>
            <div class="info">
               <label for="student-email">Email:</label>
               <input id="student-email" type="email" name="student-email" />
            </div>
            <div class="info">
               <label for="birth-date">Date of Birth:</label>
               <input id="birth-date" type="date" name="birth-date" />
            </div>
         </section>
         <!--Step 23
Within the second section element, add two div elements with a class of question-block.

Then, within each div.question-block element, add one h3 element with text of incrementing numbers, starting at 1, and one fieldset element with a class of question.-->
         <!--Step 27
Each fieldset will contain a true/false question.

Within each fieldset, nest one legend element, and one ul element with two options.         -->
         <!--Step 28
Give each fieldset an adequate name attribute. Then, give both unordered lists a class of answers-list.

Finally, use the legend to caption the content of the fieldset by placing a true/false question as the text content.         -->
         <section role="region" aria-labelledby="html-questions">
            <h2 id="html-questions">HTML</h2>
            <div class="question-block">
               <!--Step 24
The question numbers are not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the element, is to add text only a screen reader can read.

Nest a span element with a class of sr-only after the number in each of the h3 elements.-->
               <!--Step 25
Within the first span element, add the text Question.

In the second span element, add the text Question.               -->
               <h3>1 <span class="sr-only">Question</span>1</h3>
               <fieldset class="question" name="html-question-one">
                  <legend>The legend element represents a caption for the content of its
                     parent fieldset element</legend>
                  <!--Step 29Passed
                     To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow both to be selected at the same time.
                     
                     Within each list element, nest one label element, and within each label element, nest one input element with the appropriate type.-->
                  <!--Step 30
                     Add an id to all of your radio inputs so you can link your labels to them. Give the first one an id of q1-a1. Give the rest of them ids of q1-a2, q2-a1, and q2-a2, respectively.-->
                  <!--Step 31
                     Although not required for label elements with a nested input, it is still best-practice to explicitly link a label with its corresponding input element.
                     
                     Now, add a for attribute to each of your four labels that links the label to its corresponding radio input.-->
                  <!--Step 32
                     Give the label elements text such that the input comes before the text. Then, give the input elements a value matching the text.
                     
                     The text should either be True or False.-->
                  <!--Step 33
                     If you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be selected at the same time.
                     
                     Group the relevant inputs together such that only one input from a pair can be selected at a time.-->
                  <ul class="answers-list">
                     <li><label for="q1-a1"><input id="q1-a1" name="q1" type="radio" name="" value="true"> True</label>
                     </li>
                     <li><label for="q1-a2"><input id="q1-a2" name="q1" type="radio" name="" value="true"> False</label>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </fieldset>
            </div>
            <div class="question-block">
               <h3>2 <span class="sr-only">Question</span>2</h3>
               <fieldset class="question" name="html-question-two">
                  <legend>A label element nesting an input element is required to have a
                     for attribute with the same value as the input's id</legend>
                  <ul class="answers-list">
                     <li><label for="q2-a1"><input id="q2-a1" name="q2" type="radio" name="" value="true"> True</label>

            </div>
         </section>
         <!--Step 35
The final section of this quiz will contain a dropdown, and a text box.

Begin by nesting a div with a class of formrow, and nest four div elements inside of it, alternating their class attributes with question-block and answer.-->
         <!--Step 36
Within the div.question-block elements, nest one label element, and add a CSS related question to the label text.-->
         <section role="region" aria-labelledby="css-questions">
            <h2 id="css-questions">CSS</h2>
            <div class="formrow">
               <!--Step 38
Link the first label element to the select element, and give the select element a name attribute.-->
               <div class="question-block">
                  <label for="q3">The rem unit is calculated based on the value of the html element's font-size

               </div>
               <!--Step 37
Within the first div.answer element, nest one required select element with three option elements.

Give the first option element a value of "", and the text Select an option. Give the second option element a value of yes, and the text Yes. Give the third option element a value of no, and the text No.-->
               <div class="q3">
                  <select name="q3" id="q3" required>
                     <option value="">Select an option</option>

As with the other input and label elements, link the textarea to its corresponding label element, and give it a name attribute.-->
               <div class="question-block">
                  <label for="q4">Inline elements are placed on one line. True or false?</label>
