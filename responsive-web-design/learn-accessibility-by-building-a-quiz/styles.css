body {

 /*Step 8
Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

Example Code
img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In the above example, the width of the image will be 250px if the viewport width is less than 1000 pixels. If the viewport width is greater than 1000 pixels, the width of the image will be 25vw. This is because 25vw is equal to 25% of the viewport width.

Scale the image using its id as a selector, and setting the width to be the maximum of 10rem or 18vw.*/
/*Step 9
As described in the freeCodeCamp Style Guide, the logo should retain an aspect ratio of 35 / 4, and have padding around the text.

First, change the background-color to #0a0a23 so you can see the logo. Then, use the aspect-ratio property to set the desired aspect ratio to 35 / 4. Finally, add a padding of 0.4rem all around.*/
#logo {
   width: max(10rem, 18vw);
   background-color: #0a0a23;
   aspect-ratio: 35 / 4;
   padding: 0.4rem;
}
