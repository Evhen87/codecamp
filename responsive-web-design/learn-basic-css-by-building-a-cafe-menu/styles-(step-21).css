/*Step 21
The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this.

You can use the id selector to target a specific element with an id attribute. An id selector is defined by placing the hash symbol # directly in front of the element's id value. For example, if an element has the id of cat then you would target that element like this:

Example Code
#cat {
  width: 250px;
}
Use the #menu selector to give your element a width of 300px.*/

body {
   /*Step 22
Comments in CSS look like this:

Example Code
/* comment here */
/*In your style sheet, comment out the line containing the background-color property and value, so you can see the effect of only styling the #menu element. This will make the background white again.*/
   /*background-color: burlywood;*/
 }
 #menu {
   width: 300px;
 }
 h1, h2, p {
   text-align: center;
 }
