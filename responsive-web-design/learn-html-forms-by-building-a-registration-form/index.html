<!--Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.-->
<!--Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.-->
<!--Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 4
   Add a title and meta element inside the head element. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and add the charset attribute with a value of utf-8 to your meta element.-->

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Registration Form</title>
</head>

<body>

</body>
