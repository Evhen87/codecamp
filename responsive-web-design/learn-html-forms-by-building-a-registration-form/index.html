<!--Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.-->
<!--Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.-->
<!--Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--Step 4
   Add a title and meta element inside the head element. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and add the charset attribute with a value of utf-8 to your meta element.-->
<!--Step 5
   Nest a link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with a value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css.-->
<!--Step 6
   Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form.-->

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Registration Form</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<!--Step 7
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:

Example Code
Please fill out this form with the required information-->
<!--Step 11
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form element with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.-->
<!--Step 13
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.-->

<body>
   <h1>Registration Form</h1>
   <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
   <!--Step 12
The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").

Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.-->
   <form method="post" action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">
      <fieldset></fieldset>
      <fieldset></fieldset>
      <fieldset></fieldset>
   </form>
</body>
